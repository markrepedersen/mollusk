* Abstract
A distributed storage system written rust.
* Robustness techniques:
- Sharding: Data may not fit all on one machine; sharding splits data onto multiple different machines.
- Replication: To make the system fault tolerant, replicate data in case any one machine goes down.
- Consistency: Data must be consistent between replimachines.
* Optimization techniques:
- Read throughput: There may be lots and lots of requests, therefore, relevant data should be in main memory as much as possible.
- Creating a cache system: See above for motivation.
